# SCYTHE
 
This is a game made in godot for the piratesoftware16 gamejam where the theme was "You are the weapon"

## Concept
### Gameplay overview
Player controls a scythe (main character) that is bound to a girl (secondary character) and together they can perform various attacks. The player is essentially controlling both of them but narratively wise it is the scythe that is giving commands to the girl via their bonding. After defeating enemies the scythe (player) gets stronger with more powerful attacks. When the player has defeated enough enemies or beaten enough waves the game ends, the player can then get upgrades to become more powerful in their next run. 

Theme Interpretation (You are the weapon)
	“You are the weapon” - the player plays as a scythe that gets more powerful the more enemies it kills, the scythe (player) got cursed and is bound to a human, to free themselves they have to kill enemies.

### Mechanics

#### In run upgrades
Upon reaching enough kills the player can choose an upgrade for themselves lasting for the current run
